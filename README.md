# AI Projects

Yes, this is probably one of my most dedicated repos out there, but I must say I was quite lazy sometimes, so sorry in advance for those parts, and one file I would like to highlight is the Jarvis_Chat.py file, which is my most dedicated one out there and even though it contains a very small part of NN it still contains a lot of intuitive logic on the backend and might prove useful for someone aiming for beginner-level ML approach and a slight analysis towards learning how AI works in realtime.

Anyway, the Image_Generator.py is a mess right now and I have no plans on rectifying it any time soon, and I am a big fan of procastination so, I am going to create a new repo on AI Image Generation using different APIs in the future but, the Image_Recognition.py works a bit even though I did not use YOLO, I would use YOLO in another repo in the future (procastination) and I am still planning on creating a better AI project on voice recognition in the future (procastination).

All I have to say is that this was my first repo, and I put a lot of effort in the wrong places, but I have no plans on developing this further and am terminating this repo here; anyway, you might find it interesting nonetheless, so enjoy the parts you like!

Cheers, fellow coders!
